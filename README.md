# Deep-Learning-using-Medical-Data
In this project, we have done experiments on medical image data e.g. mammograms, chest x-ray etc., for detection of disease like Breast Cancer and Covid. The methodology is based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and implemented using python on the Google Colab platform.
